                <p class="n95-respirators-top-block__description">
                    The N95 mask is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling airborne particles 
                    like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised process called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms the filtration layer capable of filtering out at least 95% of airborne particles when worn correctly. 
                    During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of intense air pollution, wearing N95 masks has been shown to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, 
                    filtering out nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered 
                    respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and people with pre-existing 
                    conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly benefit from wearing face masks while 
                    they are out in public and unable to control the breathing environments that they find themselves in.

                <p class="n95-respirators-mid-block__description">
                    Most N95 respirators are manufactured for use in construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust and small particles. 
                    They are regulated by the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 
                    which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care setting. 
                    Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective devices used and worn by health care personnel during procedures to protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer of microorganisms, 
                    body fluids, and particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84
